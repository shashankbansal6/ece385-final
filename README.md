# ECE 385 Final Project
- We built a machine capable of recognizing handwritten digits using a camera module mounted on the DE2 Cyclone IV FPGA Board.
- We implemented a simple (pre-trained) Neural Network on the board, with about 93% accuracy when run in software.
- Empirical hardware tests suggest at least 80% accuracy on recognizing digits.
